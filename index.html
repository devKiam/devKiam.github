          <p class="text-justify font-essentials">
            My primary research interest is in developing AI-driven solutions for health and biomedical informatics. 
          </p><p class="text-justify font-essentials">
            I'm particularly interested in applying advanced machine learning and deep learning algorithms to extract meaningful insights from complex medical and spatiotemporal data, ranging from the molecular and clinical levels (e.g., genomics, medical imaging) to the physiological and social levels (e.g., wearable sensors, population health).
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify font-essentials">
            I'm also interested in a wide range of machine learning applications in healthcare, including Ophthalmic imaging, predictive analytics (assessing patient risk and forecasting hospital readmissions), wearable sensor data analysis (monitoring heart rate, physical activity, or blood glucose), drug discovery, remote patient monitoring, and disease diagnosis from signals, text, or images. 
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify font-essentials">
            My goal is to advance disease diagnosis, early detection, and personalized healthcare by focusing on augmenting clinical decision making, aimed at supporting, rather than replacing, clinicians by providing them with accurate, explainable, and timely insights. This approach ensures that AI acts as a trusted partner in the diagnostic process, helping clinicians make more informed decisions, reduce diagnostic errors, and deliver more tailored treatments to patients.

                DiabSense is a novel system for the early staging of type 2 diabetes (NIDDM). We developed this system to address the global challenge of undiagnosed diabetes by combining Human Activity Recognition (HAR) and Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) grading into a unified framework using advanced Graph Neural Networks (GNN). We aimed at augmenting, rather than replacing, clinicians during clinical decision making since clinicians are involded in the sytem during decision making. DiabSense reduces the need for expensive routine medical checkups and reliance on symptoms until the system alerts for an 'early diagnosis positive'. Since NIDDM symptoms are often absent in the early stages, undiagnosed patients gain an opportunity to begin medical treatment as soon as DiabSense detects a risk. Comparison between DiabSense outcomes and clinical A1C tests confirmed its reliability for accurate early diagnosis assessments.

                Grading Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is often inconsistent among ophthalmologists, which can lead to misdiagnosis. Figure 2.1 illustrates this problem: the X-axis represents US board-certified ophthalmologist graders, while the Y-axis shows patients’ retinal fundus images. The two highlighted rows demonstrate how different graders assigned varying severity levels to the same images, underscoring the need for more consistent screening. To overcome this inconsistency, our AI system ensures that every retinal image is graded with the same objective standards, removing human bias and providing consistent, repeatable results. Besides, retinal fundus images often contain irregularly shaped lesions, which makes them difficult to classify using traditional CNN-based models, since CNNs treat images as grid-like structures. Our research also addressed this challenge.
              </p>

                We developed an AI-based DR grading approach using a SwAV-based contrastive clustering model. Unlike traditional CNN or transformer models, this method classifies complex, irregular DR lesions without relying on large amounts of labeled data. SwAV’s lightweight 16-layer, 23.5-million-parameter architecture is simpler than state-of-the-art DR models, yet it outperforms CNN and transformer baselines, both independently and in ensemble setups. This work can also reduce reliance on costly routine medical checkups. Given that Diabetic Retinopathy often shows no symptoms in its early stages, undiagnosed individuals can benefit by initiating medical diagnosis through this framework. By automating early DR grading with an efficient and accessible approach, this work has strong potential to enable earlier diagnosis and treatment, helping prevent avoidable vision loss worldwide.
