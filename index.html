                DiabSense is a novel system for the early staging of type 2 diabetes (NIDDM). We developed this system to address the global challenge of undiagnosed diabetes by combining Human Activity Recognition (HAR) and Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) grading into a unified framework using advanced Graph Neural Networks (GNN). DiabSense reduces the need for expensive routine medical checkups and reliance on symptoms until the system alerts for an 'early diagnosis positive'. Since NIDDM symptoms are often absent in the early stages, undiagnosed patients gain an opportunity to begin medical treatment as soon as DiabSense detects a risk. Comparison between DiabSense outcomes and clinical A1C tests confirmed its reliability for accurate early diagnosis assessments.

                Grading Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is often inconsistent among ophthalmologists, which can lead to misdiagnosis. Figure 2.1 illustrates this problem: the X-axis represents US board-certified ophthalmologist graders, while the Y-axis shows patients’ retinal fundus images. The two highlighted rows demonstrate how different graders assigned varying severity levels to the same images, underscoring the need for more consistent screening. To overcome this inconsistency, our AI system ensures that every retinal image is graded with the same objective standards, removing human bias and providing consistent, repeatable results. Besides, retinal fundus images often contain irregularly shaped lesions, which makes them difficult to classify using traditional CNN-based models, since CNNs treat images as grid-like structures. Our research also addressed this challenge.

                We developed an AI-based DR grading approach using a SwAV-based contrastive clustering model. Unlike traditional CNN or transformer models, this method classifies complex, irregular DR lesions without relying on large amounts of labeled data. SwAV’s lightweight 16-layer, 23.5-million-parameter architecture is simpler than state-of-the-art DR models, yet it outperforms CNN and transformer baselines, both independently and in ensemble setups. This work can also reduce reliance on costly routine medical checkups. Given that Diabetic Retinopathy often shows no symptoms in its early stages, undiagnosed individuals can benefit by initiating medical diagnosis through this framework. By automating early DR grading with an efficient and accessible approach, this work has strong potential to enable earlier diagnosis and treatment, helping prevent avoidable vision loss worldwide.

                This work presents a novel, smartphone-dependent system for the early detection of type 2 diabetes (NIDDM). This work addresses the global challenge of undiagnosed diabetes by combining Human Activity Recognition (HAR) and Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) grading into a unified framework using advanced Graph Neural Networks (GNN). 
              </p>
              <p>
              In this research, I contributed to the design and validation of a system that leverages everyday smartphone sensors to monitor 23 human activities related to diabetes risk factors, using a Graph Attention Network (GAT) for HAR, and applies a Vision GNN (ViG) for DR detection from retinal images. The system fuses insights from daily activity patterns and eye health to generate early diagnosis recommendations, validated against clinical A1C test results. DiabSense demonstrated high accuracy, achieving up to 98.32% for HAR and 84.48% for DR grading on benchmark datasets. Through this work, we show that non-invasive, low-cost, and accessible technology can help millions monitor diabetes risk early and proactively seek clinical intervention. DiabSense reflects my research focus on applying AI and GNNs to solve real-world healthcare challenges using ubiquitous smart devices.
